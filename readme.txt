History of this file and updates:

Having created a Cessna 150 for X-Plane, I have long wondered what a 177 Cardinal would be like. I have had my eye on various Cardinals, but never had a chance to test fly one "for real." Drawing upon resources found on the Internet, as well as from a Cardinal down the hangar row from where I keep my 150, I began this project.

Handling the Cessna 177:

Ground handling is simple, as the nosewheel steers with rudder input. 

Takeoffs are accomplished with 10 degrees of flap, normally, and smooth rotation while keeping the plane on the extended centerline of the runway. 

Cruise of the 177 is quite easy and you may need to adjust your namifold pressure setting and prop RPM to reach 120 knots.

Landing the 177 can be accomplished with flaps or slips or a combination of both. The 177 does not slow down particularly quickly, so you may have to plan ahead. Do not flare out too high or with too much of an angle; the 177 necessitates a shallower transition to minimum energy landing.
